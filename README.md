# OrnaPG

A clicker / idle game based on <a href='https://playorna.com/gps/'>Orna</a>.

## Startup
This project is very easy to startup. <br/>
Take 2 of your favorite bash CLIs, and go to the directory with both your CLIs were the readme is located, then follow the next steps:

### Terminal One

First, we'll install the server, and start it.
```bash
cd server
npm install #Or any other package manager: bun, yarn, pnpm, etc.
npm run start
```

### Terminal Two
Then, we'll install the client, and start it too.
<i>Make sure your local port 8080 is free before starting the project ;)</i>
```bash
cd client
npm install #Or any other package manager of your choice.
npm run start
```

## Tadaa !
The project is on; enjoy calming music all the while slaughtering monsters !
